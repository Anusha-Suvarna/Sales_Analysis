## Introduction
The Sales Analysis project leverages Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Facebook Prophet to delve into sales data, understanding trends, and predicting future sales for specific stores. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives, datasets, features, file structure, and usage instructions.

## Objective
The primary aim is to analyze sales data, uncover trends, explore correlations between various factors and sales, and create predictive models for future sales based on historical data and holidays' impact.

## Dataset Overview
### Files
- `store.csv`: Includes details about each store like location, type, and assortment.
- `train.csv`: Contains daily sales data with information about date, store, sales, customers, and promotional activities.
- `merged_test.csv`: A merged dataset combining store information and sales data.

### Records and Features
- `store.csv`: Store-related records with features such as Store ID, Store Type, Assortment, Competition Distance, etc.
- `train.csv`: Daily sales records of different stores including Store ID, Date, Sales, Customers, Promotions, State Holiday, School Holiday, etc.
- `merged_test.csv`: Merged dataset combining store information and sales data.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover correlations, visualize sales trends by month, day, and day of the week.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Use Prophet to predict future sales, considering holidays' impact.
- **Visualizations**: Detailed visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of sales trends.

## Usage
1. Ensure required Python libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, fbprophet) are installed.
2. Open and run the `Sales Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the Notebook's code cells sequentially to explore, analyze, and predict sales trends.

## Data Exploration
- Correlation analysis between sales and various factors like promotions, customers, holidays, etc.
- Visualization of average sales and customers per month, day, and day of the week.

## Model Training
- Utilization of Facebook Prophet library for time series forecasting based on historical sales data.
- Consideration of state and school holidays to enhance the accuracy of sales predictions.

## Results and Visualization
- Accurate forecasting of future sales for specific stores, considering the impact of holidays.
- Detailed visualizations of predicted sales and their components.

## Conclusion
The Sales Analysis project provides valuable insights into sales trends and accurate sales predictions using historical data and holiday considerations. This analysis can aid in strategic decision-making regarding promotions, inventory management, and future planning for the stores.
